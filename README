BOSH Ninja Tools
================

Bnt is a fast way to test bosh package compilation using chroot

Usage
-----

gem install bnt

$ export CAGE_PATH=~/.bnt/cages/latest-bosh-stemcell/
$ sudo -E ./bin/bnt-create-cage

Now you are able to start testing your bosh packages like this:

$ ./bin/bnt /path/to/bosh/package

You'll need root permissions to use BNT.

Have fun!
